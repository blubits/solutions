### Legend

* **P** - Runs in >1m, fastest possible and annotated solution.
* *F* - Runs in >1m. Not necessarily optimized.
* S - Runs for <1m.
* ~~M~~ - Requires manual intervention (sorting through output or actively modifying bounds) to solve.
* x - Solved on the website, no Python code yet.
* `?` - Unknown or uncategorized.
* `<Nothing>` - Not solved yet.
