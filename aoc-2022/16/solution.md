A few critical observations:

1. You will only ever need to open the valves with an actual flow rate. In the input, this is always only a fraction of all of the valves. Thus you can really think of this problem as: in what order should you open these valves to maximize the pressure, given that there is a fixed distance (and thus a time penalty) to travel between these items.
